> Here, Arseny provides a comprehensive and concise protocol for how to carry out and analyze a visual avoidance test. I enjoyed reading it. I think it is very good. I have just a few suggestions to improve it.

Thank you so much for your praise, and for your suggestions!

> \2. “Adjust background lightness to keep the contrast high without blinding the tadpole.”

> It is difficult to know what level of light the background should be. Precisely what level of lightness blinds tadpoles? Without knowing what level of lightness blinds tadpoles, it is not possible to know how bright is too bright. For this protocol to be useable, the brightness level of the screen needs to be clearly conveyed such that others can recapitulate it. Perhaps provide an objective reference point or brightness settings or such. 

The exact point at which the tadpole will be "blinded" by the light probably depends on many factors, such as the spectrum of the light, the angular diagram of emission (for CRT monitors), and possibly more. The very idea that tadpoles can be blinded by a bright screen is strictly speaking a conjunction, based on their decreased responsiveness with highest brightness, and the fact that a decrease in visual responses after exposure to bright light is quite apparent in electrophysiological and Ca imaging experiments (Khakhalin 2014, Khakhalin 2019). This conjunction seems quite likely to be true, but technically, we have never assessed whether tadpoles were really blinded, or whether there are some other mechanisms that make them less responsive to brightest stimuli.

To make the protocol a bit more actionable, however, I now added the following sentence:

"Adjust the background lightness, to keep the contrast high without blinding the tadpole. **To assess the optimal lightness, run a series of experiments, using either this protocol, or the Optomotor Response Protocol (Dong et al. 2009), and pick the contrast with highest response rate.**"

>  \3. “…and fill it with tadpole water”.

>  Here, the author uses the term “tadpole water”. Is this the same thing as rearing media that is listed in “Reagents”? If it is the same thing, one consistent term should be used throughout the protocol (i.e. water
> should be replaced with “media"). If it is not the same, then tadpole water should be added to Reagents list.

"tadpole water" is now replaced with "tadpole media" on first use, and simply "media" after that.

>  \4. The end of step 4 is not visible. It looks like it got cut off or deleted somehow. Please fix this. In addition, the bottom of every page is missing text, so it cannot be reviewed. 

This text was visible in my version; hopefully it will be visible in the updated version as well!

>  \5. Very cool feature of having the dot turn pale during ISI to prevent habituation.

Thank you!

> “A typical responsiveness for this protocol is 80% control stage 49 tadpoles.” Please indicate here the approximate number of days post-fertilization for developmental stage 49. (This is suggested since stage 49 can encompass a relatively large window of time.)

Stage 49 is indeed the longest stage in tadpole development, and it is true that we prefer not to work with tadpoles that are still technically 49, but have grown too large. I now added the following short comment:

"A typical responsiveness for this protocol is 80% for control stage 49 tadpoles (**15-30 days post-fertilization, if raised at 20°C;** Khakhalin et al. 2014),"

> Nice idea to include Power Analysis! Very nice. 

Thank you!!

> References for this formal protocol should be restricted to peer-reviewed, accepted work. Thus, the BioRxiv reference needs to be removed, unless it has since been accepted for publication.

I think there are different opinions about the role of pre-prints in modern scientific ecosystem, and many people cite arxiv and bioarxiv papers before they are "officially" peer-reviewed. In computer science, for example, some very influential papers never get "officially" published, and still accrue hundreds of citations. (The paper YOLO3 by Redmon & Farhadi, 2018, for example, has 3.5k citations now, yet as far as I know, it never left arxiv.org)

My bioarxiv preprint contains several unique models and experiments that I think could of interest to the reader, and several colleagues have provided constructive criticism to it, that I incorporated. It is not yet officially peer-reviewed, mostly as I was too overwhelmed this year to submit it anywhere. Sorry! I hope it can be possible to retain the citation.

>  The chapter titled “Visual Collision Avoidance in Xenopus Tadpoles” by Dr. Khakhalin, has the potential to benefit several researchers in the *Xenopus* community. Xenopus has been and is still used as an excellent vertebrate model to study developmental, genetic, and biochemical dynamics. As our abilities to demonstrate molecular and cellular effects advance, so must of ability to demonstrates the functional outcomes those effects. However, there are few behavioral assays for *Xenopus* and using a commercially available platform, such as ANY-maze, is very expensive (~$1500 annual license fee). Here, Dr. Khakhalin has designed a system to video record and analyze tadpole locomotion as a function of avoidance behavior. The system is assembled using basic materials and video devices at a very low costs to researchers. The capturing and analysis can be carried out on open-source platforms, avoiding the very expensive licensing fees normally associated with behavioral analysis software. In addition to being used by researchers, the low cost of this equipment facilitates its use in undergraduate biology laboratory courses as well.

Thank you so much for your lovely and positive summary!

> In general, the chapter appears to be well written and well assembled. I have a few comments and suggestions for the author to consider for improving the manuscript:

>  Define the size of wood screws used to assemble the equipment (ex. #8 x 1” flat head).

Added (I think I might have used a mix of 1'' and 1-1/4'', but I don't think this is critical.)

> Eliminate contractions. “Won’t” is used in the last sentence in the “Projecting Device”section.

Fixed (one "won't", and one "don't").

> Add a sentence to mention how this assay can be applied to or adapter for use with other research areas, like locomotor recovery after injury. The brief mention in this possibility in the abstract is too vague.

I am not quite sure what would be the best way to write about it, as the original version of the protocol never mentioned locomotor injury, but to further stimulate the creativity of readers, I now added the following half-sentence to the last sentence in the "Discussion" session:

Together, this makes visual collision avoidance a powerful tool to dissect abnormalities in the sensorimotor system of Xenopus tadpoles, **from retinal disfunction, through sensorimotor transformation proper, and down to locomotor deficits**.

> Define a “short throw projector”, even briefly.

Added: "Short throw projector **(one capable of producing a focused image at a distance of ~1 m)**, e.g. AAXA P300"

> The author wrote “Make the black dot ~5 mm in diameter (comparable to the size of a tadpole). The “comparable” size of the dot is dependent on the developmental stage (size) of the tadpole. NF stage 49 is mentioned but do size limitations exist? Can the assay be applied to larger tadpoles at advanced developmental stages, in larger vessels? If so, it should be noted or further clarified.

The word "comparable" is often used in the "order of magnitude" sense, such that a size of a tadpole is not comparable to that of a whale, but is probably comparable to that of a ladybird bug. It seems that young s49 tadpoles respond best to dots that are somewhat similar to them in size, which may suggest that collision avoidance has something to do with schooling behaviors, and avoidance of other tadpoles, but may also be an artifact of their optics that has no deep ecological meaning. One could potentially study that by looking at larger tadpoles, or comparing visual avoidance in Xenopus laevis tadpoles to that in Xenopus tropicalis, but I have never run these experiments. I would prefer to leave this word "comparable" as a little suggestive hint that may stimulate the imagination of the reader, is it seem to have piqued your curiosity, but if you think that it is inappropriate, let me know, and I'll delete it.

> In the discussion, the term “stage” should be preceded by Nieuwkoop-Faber (NF).7. 

Added: "A typical responsiveness for this protocol is 80% for control **Nieuwkoop-Faber** stage 49 tadpoles "

> Consider showing an actual image of the experimental setup.

The photo of the setup is now added to the figure.
