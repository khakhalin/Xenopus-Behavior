A good exam question is one that is easy to ask, but hard to answer, or better yet, a question that seems simple at first, but that can lead to nuanced and productive conversations. Similarly, if we wish to probe brain development behaviorally, we should look for behaviors that are easy to evoke and quantify, but that are demanding, inherently varying, and nuanced enough to serve as a good litmus test for brain function. Visual collision detection and avoidance in Xenopus tadpoles is a good example of such a behavior: it is ecologically relevant, robust, and easy to monitor, but also nuanced, plastic, and sensitive to both the developmental history of each animal, and its recent experiences (Khakhalin 2014; James 2015; Khakhalin 2019). Here we describe how to easily set up a visual avoidance assay in a lab, and how to use it as a sensitive test of sensory processing and sensorimotor transformations in the vertebrate brain.

# Materials

## Reagents

Tadpole rearing solution: in DI H2O: 15 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM KCl, 1.0 mM MgSO4, 150 μM KH2PO4, 50 μM NaHPO4, 1.0 mM CaCl2, 0.7 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 mg/L methylene blue; pH 7.2-7.6. Other rearing solutions, such as "0.1X Steinberg" solution that is popular with some Xenopus labs, are also acceptable.

## Equipment

Projection table

> To build a projection table you will need about 1100 cm (36 feet) of 20×40 mm (1'' × 2'') pine beam; 32 wood screws; 4 furniture felt pads; 2 pieces of clean acrylic 31×31 cm (1' × 1'); and a white disposable plastic apron. See Fig 1E for a blueprint.

Short throw projector, such as AAXA P300 pico projector

> As an alternative projecting device, one can use an old CRT monitor, or an iPad-like tablet; see below.

Computer with USB connection and Internet access
Plastic Petri dish
Web-camera for video recording

Optional:

Cardboard box to cover the top of the projection device

# Method

## Preparation

1. Build a projection device. As the visual stimulus is projected on the floor of the chamber, the tadpole should be able to see this image at a sharp angle. Because of that, we cannot use a standard LCD computer monitor for stimulation, but have to either use a projector, or an old CRT monitor placed horizontally, or a good IPad-like tablet. As a test, if you cannot see the image on the screen when you bring your eye to it and look along the surface (at a sharp angle), the tadpole won't be able to see it as well.

## Recording

1. Using your browser of choice, open the depository of Xenopus behavioral protocols:
