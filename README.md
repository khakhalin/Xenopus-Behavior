# Behavioral assays in Xenopus tadpoles

A collection of software tools for behavioral studies in Xenopus tadpoles, to accompany an upcoming paper "Behavioral assays to assess neurodevelopmental function in Xenopus laevis tadpoles", by Aizenman, Khakhalin, and Lopez (CSH press).

## Java Script stimulation programs

Direct links to working versions of these programs are given [here](https://github.com/khakhalin/js-experiments)

All Java Script scripts use [p5 JS library](https://p5js.org/), and require p5 to be placed in a neighboring folder (in other words, library script tags at the beginning of each file are pointing at src="../p5/p5.js"). The scripts are tested with [version v0.9.0](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/releases/tag/0.9.0) (released July 01, 2019).
