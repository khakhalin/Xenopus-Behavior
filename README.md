# Xenopus-Behavior

A collection of software tools for behavioral studies in Xenopus tadpoles

## Java Script stimulation programs

Direct links to working versions of these programs are given [on my web-page](https://sites.google.com/view/khakhalin/research/programs)

Most of these programs use [p5 JS library](https://p5js.org/), and require p5 to be placed in a neighboring folder (in other words, library script tags at the beginning of each file are pointing at src="../p5/p5.js").
